# Medical History Intake Form

This project is a **Medical History Intake Form** built entirely in HTML and with one script in JavaScript.  
It was created as a personal exercise after learning about HTML forms on Freecodecamp.

## ✨ **About**

The form collects essential personal, contact, and medical information from a patient before a medical appointment.  
It demonstrates:
- Use of different HTML form elements (text, textarea, radio, checkbox, date, email, etc.)
- Form structure using `<fieldset>` and logical grouping
- Basic client-side interactivity using JavaScript

## 🏗️ **Features**

- Collects personal details (name, date of birth, gender)
- Contact details (address, phone, email)
- Allergy selection (with “None” logic that deselects others)
- Medication and known medical conditions
- Emergency contact details
- Preferred appointment date and signature area
- User-friendly layout and required fields for critical info

## 🚀 **How to Use**

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Fill out the form and submit.

*Note: The `action` attribute is currently set to `/action_page.php`.  
You can change this to your desired endpoint or integrate with a backend for real data collection.*

## 🛠️ **Customization**

- Add/remove input fields or questions to suit your workflow.
- Style the form with CSS for a custom appearance.
- Enhance JavaScript for more validation or interactivity.

## 🎯 **Learning Goals**

- Practice structuring accessible, user-friendly HTML forms
- Gain experience with client-side form logic (e.g., managing exclusive checkboxes)
- Understand form field requirements and data grouping
