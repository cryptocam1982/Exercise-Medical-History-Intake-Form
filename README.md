# Exercise-Medical-History-Intake-Form 

After finishing Freecodecamp's curriculum on HTML forms I have built a few small projects, to practice what I have learned.
This is the first project and it is an imaginary Medical History Intake Form, in which all sort of fields and input types 
are being shown.
